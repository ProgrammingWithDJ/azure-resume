This Website has been exposed to a CDN using a custom domain, the static website is stored in a storage account.
It also has one Javascript function which triggers a Azure function to store the visitor count in Azure cosmos DB.


We have also implemented CICD through Azure dev-ops to deploy automatically and do the purging to get the fresh data everytime.
